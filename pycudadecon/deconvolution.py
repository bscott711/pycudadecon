    r"""Deconvolve an image or images with a PSF or OTF file

    If `images` is a directory, use the `fpattern` argument to select files
    by filename pattern.

    Args:
        images (str, np.ndarray, list, tuple): The array, filepath,
            directory, or list/tuple thereof to deconvolve
        psf (str, np.ndarray): a filepath of a PSF or OTF file, or a 3D numpy
            PSF array.  Function will auto-detect whether the file is a 3D PSF
            or a filepath representing a 2D complex OTF.
        fpattern (str, optional): Defaults to '\*.tif'. Filepattern to use when
            a directory is provided in the ``images`` argument
        ** kwargs: optional keyword arguments listed below
        ** dxdata (float): The xy pixel size of the ``image``. Defaults to 0.1
        ** dzdata (float): The z step size of the ``image``. Defaults to 0.5
        ** dxpsf (float): The xy pixel size of the ``psf``. Defaults to 0.1
        ** dzpsf (float): The z step size of the ``psf``. Defaults to 0.1
        ** background (int): Background to subtract.  use 'auto' to subtract
            median val of last Z plane. Defaults to 80
        ** deskew (float): Angle to deskew data (for stage scanning acquisition).
            Defaults to 0
        ** pad_val (int): Value to pad edges with when deskewing. Should be
            zero when ``background`` is 'auto' Defaults to 0
        ** rotate (float): Degrees to rotate volume in Y axis (to make Z axis
            orthogonal to coverslip). Defaults to 0
        ** width (int): Width of output image (0 = full). Defaults to 0
        ** n_iters (int): Number of iterations in deconvolution Defaults to 10
        ** save_deskewed (bool): Save raw deskewed files (if deskew > 0).
            Defaults to False
        ** napodize (int): Number of pixels to soften edge with. Defaults to 15
        ** nz_blend (int): Number of top and bottom sections to blend in to reduce
            axial ringing. Defaults to 0
        ** dup_rev_z (bool): Duplicate reversed stack prior to decon to reduce axial
            ringing. Defaults to False
        ** wavelength (int): Wavelength in nanometers (for OTF cleanup). Defaults to 520
        ** fixorigin (int):  For all kz, extrapolate using pixels kr=1 to this pixel to
            get value for kr=0. Defaults to 10
        ** otf_bgrd (None, int): Background to subtract in PSF (None = autodetect).
            Defaults to None
        ** na (float): Numerical aperture (for OTF cleanup). Defaults to 1.25]
        ** nimm (float): Refractive index of medium (for OTF cleanup). Defaults to 1.3
        ** krmax (int): Pixels outside this limit will be zeroed (overwriting estimated
            value from ``na`` and ``nimm``). Defaults to 0
        ** cleanup_otf (bool): Clean up OTF outside of OTF support. Defaults to False

    Raises:
        ValueError: If save_deskewed is True and deskew is unset or 0
        IOError: If a directory is provided as input and ``fpattern`` yields no files
        NotImplementedError: If ``psf`` is provided as a complex, 2D numpy array
            (OTFs can only be provided as filenames created with :func:`pycudadecon.make_otf`)

    Returns:
        np.ndarray, list: numpy array or list of arrays (deconvolved images)

        If the input ``images`` is a single array, or filepath, then the returned
        value will be a single 3D image volume.

        If the input is a directory or a list of arrays, then the returned value
        will be a list of 3D image volumes.

        if ``save_deskewed == True``, returns a tuple (decon, deskewed) or a list
        of tuples (if input was iterable)

    Examples:

        deconvolve a 3D TIF volume with a 3D PSF volume (e.g. a single bead stack)

        >>> impath = '/path/to/image.tif'
        >>> psfpath = '/path/to/psf.tif'
        >>> result = decon(impath, psfpath)

        deconvolve all TIF files in a specific directory that match a certain
        `filename pattern <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/fnmatch.html>`_,
        (in this example, all TIFs with the string '560nm' in their name)

        >>> imdirectory = '/directory/with/images'
        >>> psfpath = '/path/to/psf.tif'
        >>> result = decon(imdirectory, psfpath, fpattern='*560nm*.tif')

        deconvolve a list of images, provided either as np.ndarrays, filepaths,
        or directories

        >>> imdirectory = '/directory/with/images'
        >>> impath = '/path/to/image.tif'
        >>> imarray = tifffile.imread('some_other_image.tif')
        >>> psfpath = '/path/to/psf.tif'
        >>> result = decon([imdirectory, impath, imarray],
        ...                 psfpath, fpattern='*560nm*.tif')
